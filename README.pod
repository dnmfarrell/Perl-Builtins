=head2 SYNOPSIS

    use Perl::Builtins;

    # get an array of functions
    my @builtin_functions = Perl::Builtins::list;

    # get an arrayref instead
    my $builtin_functions = Per::Builts::list;

=head2 DESCRIPTION

This module simply returns a list of strings of all the builtin functions in Perl. In scalar context it returns an arrayref.

=head2 RATIONALE

I wrote this module because several times I have needed a list of all builtin functions in Perl, and couldn't find an easy way to get it. Then Father Chrysostomos pointed me towards L<B::Keywords>. You should probably use that.
